NanoVer Fundamentals
====================

We provide a set of Jupyter notebook tutorials that introduce NanoVer as a framework for performing interactive
molecular dynamics simulations, and the fundamental concepts associated with the client-server
architecture that NanoVer uses. These tutorials can be used in conjunction with the
information in :ref:`concepts <Concepts>` to understand how NanoVer works and are found in the
`tutorials <https://github.com/IRL2/nanover-server-py/tree/main/tutorials/fundamentals>`_ folder of the GitHub repository.

Here we give a summary of each tutorial:

* `commands_and_state`: A notebook that introduces the concepts of **commands**, and explains
  how NanoVer achieves synchronised multi-user interactive molecular simulations via the
  **shared state** dictionary.
* `visualisations`: A notebook that demonstrates how to change the **visualisation** of the
  interactive molecular simulation within the NanoVer iMD-VR client.
