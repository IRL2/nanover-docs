A set of tutorials that demonstrate how to use NanoVer to run interactive molecular
dynamics simulations using OpenMM directly.

The Jupyter notebook tutorials that demonstrate how to run interactive molecular
dynamics simulations by interfacing NanoVer with OpenMM directly can be found in
the `examples <https://github.com/IRL2/nanover-protocol/tree/main/examples/openmm>`_
folder of the GitHub repository. It contains:

* `openmm_polyalanine`: A notebook that demonstrates how to set up an interactive
  OpenMM simulation from scratch with NanoVer, use features of OpenMM in conjunction
  with NanoVer, and how to record and playback simulations directly using NanoVer.
* `openmm_nanotube`: A notebook that demonstrates how to interact with an OpenMM
  NanoVer simulation using a python client.
* `openmm_neuraminidase`: A notebook that demonstrates how to set up an interactive
  OpenMM simulation from scratch with NanoVer and change the visualisations of
  different atom selections for a protein-ligand system.
