MDAnalysis
==========

A set of tutorials that demonstrate how NanoVer can be interfaced with MDAnalysis to visualise static structures and
trajectories in VR.
These can be found in the
`examples folder <https://github.com/IRL2/nanover-protocol/tree/main/examples/mdanalysis>`_ of the GitHub repository.

* `mdanalysis_lsd`: A notebook that demonstrates how to import a pdb into MDAnalysis and visualise this structure in VR,
  including changing the visualisation of different parts of the system, e.g. protein/ligands/lipids, using MDAnalysis
  selections.
* `mdanalysis_trajectory`: A notebook that demonstrates how to import a trajectory into MDAnalysis from the topology
  (pdb) and trajectory (dcd) files and show this in VR. Learn how to hook up python commands such as play/pause/reset to
  the corresponding buttons on the handheld menu in the VR application.
